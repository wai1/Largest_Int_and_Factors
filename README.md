# Largest_Int_and_Factors

This program determines which is the largest integer in two arrays.
It then calculates the factors of the integer and places them in the
factors vector array. Each of those elements are tested against all
elements in the  input arrays to determine which are either factors
of the elements in the input arrays or the elements in the input 
arrays are factor of the elements in the factors array.
